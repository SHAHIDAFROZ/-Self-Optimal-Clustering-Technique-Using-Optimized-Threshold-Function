# Self optimal clustering Algorithm Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a clustering algorithm using Python, focusing on the calculation of various metrics such as delta, delta1, silhouette indices (s1, s2), silhouette index (S), and partition index (PI). The algorithm clusters the pixels of an image into two clusters and computes these metrics over several iterations. Additionally, it visualizes the evolution of the silhouette index (S) and partition index (PI) across the iterations.

## Files

- `clustering_algorithm.py`: The main Python script that performs the clustering, computes metrics, and generates plots.

## Requirements

To run the script, you need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
